<b>y</b> loads state (must be running) (pauses).<br>
<br>
<b>Repairs required:</b> If 'Yes' then traps must be repaired for runner to die at them, if 'No' then broken traps can kill runners.<br>
<b>Infinite food:</b> If 'Yes' then you have infinite food, if 'No' then start with 9 of each.<br>
<b>Require log and hammer to repair:</b> If 'Yes' then you must have a log and hammer to repair a trap, if 'No' then can repair without.<br>
<b>Pause to save/load:</b> If 'Yes' then you must pause before saving/loading, if 'No' then can save/load while unpaused.<br>
<b>Runner movements:</b> Forced runner movements. For example, 'ww-e-s' for first runner west west, second runner east, third runner south.<br>
<b>Tick duration (milliseconds):</b> Set the length of a game tick.<br>
<b>Toggle tile marker mode:</b> Click to to switch between movement and tile marker mode.<br>
While in tile marker mode, left-clicking an unmarked tile will mark it and left-clicking a marked tile will unmark it.<br>
Click the colored rectangle beside 'Marker' to change the color of marked tiles.<br>
<br>
<b>Save/Load:</b><br>
If you save with <b>s</b>, then loading with <b>y</b> will bring to to the same state on the same wave you saved. Unpause with <b>p</b><br>
Defender level will behave as it was when you saved. Runner movements are calculated dynamically, so they will vary each time you load.<br>
Tick duration can be changed by stopping the wave, changing tick duration, then starting the wave, then loading.<br>
Repair requirement is dynamic and will be whatever the value currently is set to via the selection menu.<br>
Although the wave and defender level will behave the same as when you saved, the selection in the menu will not change when you load.<br>
So, if you change the selection, start, then load: you will load from the saved wave and level, but they will not change in selectors.<br>
If you then stop and start the wave, it will play with the wave and level displayed in the selectors normally (not from loaded wave/level).<br>
<br>
First food is always tofu (for convenience), changes to random new food every 50 ticks (52, 102, 152, etc.).<br>
<br>
To multikill, move off stack when last digit of tick is 1. They will eat when last digit is 4.<br>

Please let me know if anything is not working correctly. -McLovin1981<br>
